## How its made
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

The Artisan's Slice website was built using HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and responsive layout. The structure is crafted with semantic HTML elements to ensure accessibility and readability, while CSS is used to style the pages with attention to typography, color schemes, and layout consistency that reflects the restaurantâ€™s artisanal aesthetic.

## Optimizations
1. Formatting of media
- To improve loading times and overall performance, I optimized the images in the project by converting PNG and JPEG files to WebP format. WebP offers superior compression without compromising image quality, reducing file sizes and speeding up page load times. Additionally, I utilized Webm for video content to ensure faster streaming with lower bandwidth usage, further enhancing user experience, especially on slower connections.

## What I learned
1. Layouts and Responsive Design
 - Through this project, I deepened my understanding of **layouts and responsive design**. I learned how to structure web pages using flexbox to create flexible, adaptable layouts that respond well to different screen sizes. I also gained experience with media queries, ensuring the design adjusts fluidly across devices. This helped me appreciate the importance of designing for accessibility and user experience across various resolutions and viewports.
2. Iframes
 - While working with **iframes**, I learned how powerful they can be for embedding external content like interactive maps directly into a webpage. I also discovered the importance of handling cross-origin policies and security concerns when embedding third-party content.
3. Tables
 -  I gained a better understanding of how to effectively structure and organize data using tables. By breaking down information into well-defined rows and columns, I learned how to present data in a clear and accessible way. This experience also helped me become more comfortable with HTML table elements and styling them with CSS to enhance both functionality and visual appeal.
